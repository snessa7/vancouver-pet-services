# Netlify Forms Integration Subagent Workflow

## Overview
A specialized subagent designed to automatically detect and fix Netlify Forms integration issues across HTML files in web projects. This agent ensures proper form configuration, validation, and submission handling for seamless Netlify Forms functionality.

## Agent Capabilities

### 1. Form Detection & Analysis
- **Search HTML Files**: Automatically scans all HTML files in the project for form elements
- **Identify Form Types**: Distinguishes between contact forms, signup forms, newsletter forms, etc.
- **Catalog Form Attributes**: Documents current form configurations including action URLs, method types, and Netlify-specific attributes

### 2. Configuration Issue Detection
The subagent will identify and flag these common Netlify Forms issues:

#### Critical Issues:
- Incorrect Netlify attribute format (`netlify=""` instead of `data-netlify="true"`)
- Missing `data-netlify="true"` attribute on forms intended for Netlify
- Missing or incorrect `name` attribute on form elements
- Missing hidden `form-name` input field
- Incorrect `form-name` value (must match form's `name` attribute)

#### Warning Issues:
- Inconsistent action URL formats
- Missing method="POST" on forms
- Forms without proper validation attributes
- Missing honeypot fields for spam protection
- Inconsistent form styling or structure

### 3. Automated Fix Procedures

#### Primary Fixes:
1. **Netlify Attribute Correction**
   - Replace `netlify=""` with `data-netlify="true"`
   - Replace `netlify` (boolean) with `data-netlify="true"`
   - Add missing `data-netlify="true"` to identified forms

2. **Form Name Validation**
   - Ensure every form has a unique `name` attribute
   - Add hidden `form-name` input with matching value
   - Validate naming conventions (kebab-case recommended)

3. **Action URL Standardization**
   - Ensure proper success page redirects
   - Add query parameters for form tracking
   - Validate URL format and accessibility

4. **Method Attribute Validation**
   - Ensure `method="POST"` on all Netlify forms
   - Flag any forms using GET method inappropriately

#### Secondary Enhancements:
1. **Honeypot Integration**
   - Add `netlify-honeypot` attributes for spam protection
   - Include hidden honeypot fields in form structure

2. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Ensure proper label-input associations
   - Add required field indicators
   - Validate ARIA attributes

## Search Patterns & Detection Logic

### File Discovery Patterns:
```regex
**/*.html
**/*.htm
**/templates/**/*.html
**/pages/**/*.html
```

### Form Element Detection:
```regex
<form[^>]*>.*?</form>
```

### Netlify Forms Identification:
```regex
# Correct patterns (should be preserved):
data-netlify="true"
netlify-honeypot="[field-name]"

# Incorrect patterns (need fixing):
netlify=""
netlify="true"
netlify\s+(?!-)  # netlify as boolean attribute
netlify="[^"]*"  # netlify with any other value
```

### Missing Components Detection:
```regex
# Forms missing required components:
<form(?![^>]*data-netlify)  # Missing data-netlify
<form(?![^>]*name=)         # Missing name attribute
(?!.*<input[^>]*name="form-name")  # Missing form-name input
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Analysis
1. Scan project directory for HTML files
2. Parse each file for form elements
3. Catalog current form configurations
4. Generate issue report with severity levels

### Phase 2: Validation
1. Cross-reference form configurations with Netlify best practices
2. Identify forms intended for Netlify (vs. external endpoints)
3. Validate form structure and required fields
4. Check for duplicate form names or conflicts

### Phase 3: Automated Fixes
1. Apply critical fixes (Netlify attributes, form names)
2. Implement standardization (action URLs, methods)
3. Add missing components (honeypot, hidden fields)
4. Preserve existing functionality and styling

### Phase 4: Verification
1. Re-scan fixed files to confirm corrections
2. Validate HTML syntax after modifications
3. Generate post-fix report with changes made
4. Recommend additional manual review if needed

## Error Handling & Safety

### Backup Strategy:
- Create backup copies of modified files
- Log all changes made with timestamps
- Provide rollback functionality if issues occur

### Validation Checks:
- Ensure HTML remains valid after modifications
- Preserve existing form functionality
- Maintain CSS class names and styling hooks
- Verify no duplicate IDs or names are created

### Conflict Resolution:
- Handle multiple forms on single page
- Resolve naming conflicts automatically
- Maintain unique identifiers across project

## Integration Points

### File Types Supported:
- Static HTML files
- Template files (with HTML structure)
- Component files containing form markup

### Framework Compatibility:
- Static site generators (Jekyll, Hugo, etc.)
- JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, Angular) with HTML templates
- Traditional HTML/CSS/JS websites

### Development Workflow Integration:
- Pre-commit hooks for form validation
- Build process integration
- Continuous integration checks

## Configuration Options

### Customizable Settings:
- Form naming conventions
- Success page URL patterns
- Required field validation rules
- Honeypot field preferences
- Custom attribute preservation

### Project-Specific Rules:
- Exclude certain files from processing
- Custom form identification patterns
- Specific Netlify features to enable/disable
- Integration with existing form handling

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Benefits:
- All forms properly configured for Netlify
- Consistent form structure across project
- Elimination of common submission failures
- Improved form accessibility

### Long-term Advantages:
- Reduced manual form debugging
- Standardized development practices
- Improved user experience
- Better form submission tracking

## Example Fix Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Business Signup Form
**Before:**
```html
<form action="/success.html" method="POST" netlify name="business-signup">
    <input type="text" name="business-name" required>
    <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
</form>
```

**After:**
```html
<form action="/success.html?form=business" method="POST" data-netlify="true" name="business-signup">
    <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="business-signup">
    <input type="text" name="business-name" required>
    <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
</form>
```

### Scenario 2: Contact Form with Honeypot
**Before:**
```html
<form action="/contact-success" method="GET" name="contact">
    <input type="email" name="email">
    <textarea name="message"></textarea>
    <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

**After:**
```html
<form action="/contact-success?form=contact" method="POST" data-netlify="true" netlify-honeypot="bot-field" name="contact">
    <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="contact">
