## Analysis

The domain vancouverpetservices.com is active and connected to Netlify's DNS servers, but the required email forwarding records have not been added yet. This is expected if the DNS configuration hasn't been completed in the Netlify dashboard.

## Required Actions

### 1. Add DNS Records in Netlify (URGENT)

Log into Netlify and add these DNS records:

**MX Records:**
```
Type: MX
Name: @ (or leave blank)
Priority: 10
Value: mx1.improvmx.com

Type: MX
Name: @ (or leave blank)
Priority: 20
Value: mx2.improvmx.com
```

**TXT Record:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: @ (or leave blank)
Value: v=spf1 include:spf.improvmx.com ~all
```

### 2. Verify in ImprovMX Dashboard
- Ensure vancouverpetservices.com is added
- Verify the email alias "info" is set to forward to snessa7@gmail.com

## Next Test Schedule

The automated monitoring system will check DNS status every 30 minutes:

- **Next Check**: 2025-06-01 15:20 PST
- **Test #3**: 2025-06-01 15:50 PST
- **Test #4**: 2025-06-01 16:20 PST

## DNS Propagation Timeline

- **Current Status**: DNS records not configured
- **Expected Configuration Time**: Immediate after adding in Netlify
- **Expected Propagation**: 1-4 hours typically, up to 48 hours maximum

## Recommendation

Please add the DNS records in Netlify as soon as possible. The monitoring system is ready and will automatically detect when the DNS is configured and begin email forwarding tests.
