# üö® URGENT: DNS Configuration Required

**Date**: June 1, 2025  
**Time**: 2:50 PM PST  
**Domain**: vancouverpetservices.com  

## ‚ùå Current Status: EMAIL FORWARDING NOT WORKING

The email forwarding for info@vancouverpetservices.com is **NOT WORKING** because the DNS records haven't been added in Netlify yet.

## üîß Required Action: Add DNS Records in Netlify

### Step 1: Log into Netlify
1. Go to [Netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Log in to your account
3. Find your site/domain: vancouverpetservices.com

### Step 2: Navigate to DNS Settings
1. Click on "Domains" in the main menu
2. Click on "vancouverpetservices.com"
3. Click on "DNS settings" or "DNS panel"

### Step 3: Add These Records EXACTLY

#### MX Record 1:
- **Type**: MX
- **Name**: @ (or leave blank)
- **Priority**: 10
- **Value**: mx1.improvmx.com

#### MX Record 2:
- **Type**: MX
- **Name**: @ (or leave blank)
- **Priority**: 20
- **Value**: mx2.improvmx.com

#### TXT Record (for SPF):
- **Type**: TXT
- **Name**: @ (or leave blank)
- **Value**: v=spf1 include:spf.improvmx.com ~all

### Step 4: Save Changes
Click "Save" or "Add Record" for each entry

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline

- **DNS Addition**: Immediate (as soon as you add them)
- **DNS Propagation**: 1-4 hours typically
- **Email Working**: Shortly after propagation

## ü§ñ Automated Monitoring Active

I've set up automated monitoring that checks every 30 minutes. Once you add the DNS records:

1. The system will detect them automatically
2. Email tests will begin
3. You'll receive confirmation when it's working

## üìä Check Status

Run this command to see current status:
```bash
./quick-email-test.sh
```

Or view the dashboard:
```bash
cat email-test-dashboard.md
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Tuesday Launch**: You need email working for your Tuesday marketing launch
2. **Current Day**: Sunday - you have time, but act soon
3. **Support**: If you need help with Netlify, their support can assist with DNS setup

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If you've added the records but they're not showing:
1. Make sure you clicked "Save" in Netlify
2. Records should appear immediately in Netlify's DNS panel
3. Global propagation takes 1-48 hours
4. Check [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/MXLookup.aspx) to verify

**ACTION REQUIRED**: Please add the DNS records in Netlify now to ensure email is working before your Tuesday launch.
