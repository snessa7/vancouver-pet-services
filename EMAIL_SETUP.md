# Email Setup Instructions

## Current Status
- **Public Display:** info@vancouverpetservices.com (professional)
- **Forms Send To:** sness7@icloud.com (your personal email for now)

## To Set Up Professional Email

### Option 1: Using Your Domain (Recommended)
Once you buy a domain like `vancouverpetservices.com`:

1. **Google Workspace** ($6/month)
   - Go to workspace.google.com
   - Set up info@vancouverpetservices.com
   - Professional, reliable, includes calendar/docs

2. **Zoho Mail** (Free for 1 user)
   - Go to zoho.com/mail
   - Free professional email
   - Good for starting out

### Option 2: Quick Professional Email (Free)
- Create: vancouverpetservices@gmail.com
- Update the JavaScript email handlers
- Looks more professional than personal email

## When You're Ready
Update these two places in `index.html`:

1. **Line 690:** Change `mailto:sness7@icloud.com` to your new email
2. **Line 671:** Change the business listing email handler

## Benefits of Professional Email
- Builds trust with customers
- Easier to track business vs personal emails
- Professional appearance
- Better for marketing/outreach

## Current Setup Works For Launch
Your personal email will receive all inquiries, but visitors see the professional address. You can set up forwarding later!
